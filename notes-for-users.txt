Compo4All (ROT season 2?) is descended from PanMAME (thanks mcobit!)

MAME 0.106 based, so thats your romset to follow.

Game chocie for game 1 for testing is Ms Pacman -- near everyone should have a legal license to this ROM; if you've
ever purchased a Namco arcade collection for xbox, PSP, whatever, you should be good to go (otherwise, go get one from
the bargain bin for a fiver and have legal ROM licenses to a pile of great games :)

Running Compo4All MAME requires a network connection:
  - the launcher client will not work without it
  - the hiscore management will not work without it

C4A manages hi-scores (for specific games) on remote server! When the emu launches you'll have a generated hi-score
table mnatching the current board highest scores! When you close the emu, any winning scores will be published to the
server. In this fashion, you're competing with everyone who joins in!

  - Save-states are disabled in the emu.
  - Quarters are permitted (you can add more in) for now; it would be too annoying to force 'iron man' and onyl 1 quarter :)
  - if you want to practice endlessly, you might want to use PanMAME or mame4all or any other mame, just to get the more
    complete experience without also needing a network connection

The front-end is quite simple
  - first run, you must create your profile (so that any scores (regardless of what name you put in-game) will be
    registered against your profile); do not delete your profile, or lose it!
  - once you've got a profile set up, it will let you run any of the current seasons games

Please play honorably and don't try to cheat; it is not particularly difficult to cheat (I can think of a dozen ways off top
of my head)
  - My goal is to arrange a _competition_ here, so if we have cheating.. we can't do a compo :(
  - If people cheat, I may have to resort to forcing playback recording and proving authenticity of playback files and such,
    which is a big pile of no-fun
  - Trying to use playback files from online and calling them yours .. will get you beaten
  - Trying to use alternate emu builds .. will get you beaten
  - Trying to hexedit score files and ROMs .. will get you beaten (I don't want to start checksumming executables and ROMs and so forth, please)
  - Trying to impersonate someone else in name or by using their profile .. lame!
  - Trying to attack my server-side to fake scores .. lame!
  - .. etc .. We're all friends here, lets be sportsman
