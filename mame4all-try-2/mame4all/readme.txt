===========================================================


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

It is a port of MAME 0.37b5 emulator by Nicola Salmoria for GP2X and WIZ portable consoles.
To see MAME license see the end of this document (chapter 18).
It emulates all arcade games supported by original MAME 0.37b5 plus some additional
games from newer MAME versions.

This version emulates 2270 different romsets.

2. CONTROLS
-----------

The emulator controls are the next ones:
- Joystick: Movement in pad, mouse and analog control of the four players. 
- Buttons B,X,A,Y,L,R: Buttons A,B,C,D,E,F.
- Button SELECT: Insert credits (UP+SELECT = 2P credits, RIGHT+SELECT = 3P credits, DOWN+SELECT = 4P credits).
- Button START (MENU): start (UP+START = 2P start, RIGHT+START = 3P start, DOWN+START = 4P start).
- Button L+R: Pause.
- Buttons L+R+START: Exit to selection menu to select another game.
- Buttons L+START (MENU) simultaneously: Show profiler.
- Buttons R+SELECT simultaneously: Show FPS.
- Buttons START+SELECT simultaneously: Access to the MAME menu.
- Buttons VolUp and VolDown: Increase / decrease sound volume.
- USB Joypads: Up to four USB Joypads are supported for multiplayer in the GP2X.

In the rotated video modes the following additional controls are available:
- GP2X: Buttons VolUp and VolDown: Buttons A and B.
- GP2X: Buttons VolUp and VolDown + START: Increase / decrease sound volume.
- WIZ: Button MENU: Button A.

NOTE: To type OK when MAME requires it, press LEFT and then RIGHT.

3. EMULATION OPTIONS
--------------------

After selecting a game on the list next configuration options are available:

- Clock:
In the GP2X: 66 to 300 MHz options are available. Performance of the emulator is better with bigger values.
200 MHz is the standard value. 250 MHz seems to run ok with all GP2X consoles (but batteries duration is reduced).
Use greater values at your own risk!.
In the WIZ: 200 to 900 MHz options are available. Performance of the emulator is better with bigger values.
533 MHz is the standard value. 700 MHz seems to run ok with all WIZ consoles (but batteries duration is reduced).
Use greater values at your own risk!.

- Video Depth:
It allows to configure the video depth. The possible values are:
Auto: The emulator uses the most suitable video depth.
8 bit: The emulator is forced to use 8 bit color.
16 bit: The emulator uses 16 bit color.

- Video Aspect:
The video aspect is configured with the following combination of options:
Normal: Nominal video resolution (320x240).
Scale: The game window is scaled to fill the entire screen.
4:3: The 4:3 aspect ratio is forced.
Border: A border is added to be able to see the entire screen in the TV.
Rotate: The window is rotated to be played with the GP2X.
TATE: The window is rotated to be played in a rotated TV.
Diagonal Fix: WIZ video diagonal line is fixed but with impact in the performance.

- Video Sync:
Normal: Single buffer and dirty buffer is used.
VSync: VSync activated.
DblBuf: Double buffer without dirty buffer.
OFF: No video synchronization, use manual frameskip.

- Frame-Skip:
Auto: The frameskip is adjusted automatically in real time.
0 to 11: The frameskip is manually adjusted. The selected frames each 12 are skipped.

- Sound:
The sound options are the following ones:
ON: The sound is activated. 11, 15, 22, 33 and 44 KHz sound mixing rates are available in both mono and stereo.
OFF: The sound is disabled.
Fast sound: Some tweaks are done to improve the performance (but with a bit worse sound quality).

- CPU Clock:
The clock of the CPUs can be adjusted from 50% to 200%. The nominal value is 100% and the CPU is emulated accurately.
The clock can be safely underclocked to about 80% to gain performance in almost all games (be careful because some
games could not run correctly). Use lower values to get more performance but probably several more games would not
run correctly. Also the clock can be overclocked up to 200% to avoid slowdowns in some Neo·Geo games.

- Audio Clock:
The clock of the audio CPUs can also be adjusted from 50% to 200%. The nominal value is 100%. It can be underclocked
and overclocked as well.

- CPU ASM Cores:
The following combinations of CPU ASM cores are available:
Cyclone: It is the M68000 ASM CPU core, faster than the C one. Enable it because it seems to have perfect compatibility.
DrZ80: It is the Z80 ASM CPU core, faster than the C one. The compatibility is very limited, use it if the desired game runs ok.
Cyclone+DrZ80: Both ASM CPU cores are activated. More faster.
Drz80(snd): DrZ80 is only used for the sound CPUs.
Cyclone+DrZ80(snd): Both ASM cores are activated, DRz80 only for the sound CPUs.
None: None of the ASM CPU cores are activated. Slower.
Note that this configuration is automatically adjusted in each game according to an internal compatibility list.

- RAM Tweaks:
ON: The RAM Tweaks are activated to gain some more performance. Some consoles have problems with them. Try it.
OFF: The RAM Tweaks are disabled to ensure the emulator run on every console.

- Cheats:
ON: The cheats are enabled. To access in game press SELECT+START and enter the "Cheats" menu.
OFF: The cheats are disabled.
Note: The high scores are not saved if cheats are enabled!!!.

- Volume:
Quiet: Quiet default volume.
Low: Low default volume.
Medium: Medium default volume.
Maximum: Maximum default volume.
Note that the default volume can be changed using the console volume controls.

- Auto-Fire:
To access the auto-fire configuration, during game press SELECT+START and enter the "Auto-Fire" menu.

- Press B to play the selected game or X to go back to game selection menu.

- In the game selection menu if L+R are pressed simultaneously, the frontend is ended.

(*) mame_vm.gpe uses 64 MB swap file in the root of SD card to be able to play the biggest games.
It is not recommended due to the maximum number of SD card writings (about 500.000). It will reduce
the life of your SD card. Use at your own risk!

5. SUPPORTED GAMES
------------------

There are 2270 different supported romsets. For more details, see "gamelist.txt" file.
Games have to be copied into the roms/ folder on the SD card.


6. ROM NAMES
------------

Folder names or ZIP file names are listed on "gamelist.txt" file.
Romsets have to be MAME 0.37b5 ones (July 2000).
Additionaly there are additional romsets from newer MAME versions.

Please use "clrmame.dat" file to convert romsets from other MAME versions to the ones used by
this version for GP2X, using ClrMAME Pro utility, available in next webpage:

http://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/

NOTE: File and directory names in Linux are case-sensitive. Put all file and directory names
using low case!.


7. SOUND SAMPLES
----------------

The sound samples are used to get complete sound in some of the oldest games.
They are placed into the 'samples' directory compressed into ZIP files.
The directory and the ZIP files are named using low case!.

The sound samples collection can be downloaded in the following link:
http://dl.openhandhelds.org/cgi-bin/gp2x.cgi?0,0,0,0,5,2511

You can also use "clrmame.dat" file with ClrMAME Pro utility to get the samples pack.


8. ARTWORK
----------

Artwork is used to improve the visualization for some of the oldest games. Download it here:
