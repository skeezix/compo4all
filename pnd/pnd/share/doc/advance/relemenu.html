<center><h2>Release Notes For AdvanceMENU</h2></center>
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.4.7
</h2>
This version uses for DOS the new SVGALIB 1.9.20 library that
adds support for the latest Radeon and nVidia video boards.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.3.8
</h2>
This release adds support for specific emulator configuration
options. Please note that these specific emulator
configurations are not activated if you select to show
more than one emulator at time.
In this case only the default configuration is used.
Specifically these special options are `mode', `sort',
`preview', `group_include' and `type_include'.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.3.0
</h2>
This release changes the manual compilation process in DOS
and Windows. You must now use the Makefile.usr file instead of
the old Makefile.in file. Check the build.txt file for more details.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.14
</h2>
This release removes the legacy support for the DOS
unchained VGA modes and for the banked VBE modes. It means
that you now need a supported SVGA or VBE2 video card.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.10
</h2>
This release contains a new set of `event' Linux
drivers for keyboards, mice and joysticks based on the Linux
input-event interfaces.
These drivers remove any limitations on the number of
keyboards, mice and joysticks, and they give the best
support for the new USB HID devices.
<p>
The `raw' set of Linux drivers has now the same functionality
of the `svgalib' set. If you don't need the SVGALIB video you can
now completely remove this library.
<p>
In Linux the host configuration files are now read in /etc,
the files in */share/advance have now less priority
of the user specified options. They can be used
to set default options.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.7
</h2>
This release adds support for the new MAME -listxml option. It's now
used as default. The old -listinfo is still supported and it's used
if -listxml fails.
<p>
The xml file is saved with the .xml extension. You probably want to
remove the old .lst file.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.6
</h2>
This release supports Mac OS X with the SDL library. Please note that
it isn't able to directly program your video board, so you cannot use
it with an Arcade Monitor.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.5
</h2>
The precompiled DOS binary of this release is compiled with
the old gcc 2.95.3. Please report if this fixes any know
problem.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.2
</h2>
The option `video_depth' is now removed. The video bit depth is
chosen automatically. If you need to exclude some depth you can
use the new `device_color_*' options.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.1
</h2>
The `group' and `type' menus are now accessible only from the
main menu. The `group' and `type' events now automatically switch
to the next item without displaying a menu.
The selection logic is: first item, second item, ..., last item,
all items, and repeat.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.2.0
</h2>
This is the first Windows NT/2000/XP version able to directly
program your video board. This puts the Windows version at the same level
of the other Linux and DOS versions. It's very experimental, and tested only
with a GeForce 2. Anyway, it should work with all the video boards that
work in DOS and Linux because the SVGA drivers are the same.
<p>
To use these video drivers you need to install the SVGAWIN.sys driver with the
SVGAWIN.exe utility. If installed, AdvanceMENU automatically tries to use it
unless you set a specific driver with the `device_video' option.
If you don't install the SVGAWIN.sys driver AdvanceMENU works like the previous
version using only the SDL library.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 2.0.0
</h2>
The emulator type `mame' is now used for the Windows MAME.
The DOS MAME now requires the `dmame' emulator type.
The DOS MESS now requires the `dmess' emulator type.
The DOS Raine now requires the `draine' emulator type.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 1.17.4
</h2>
The option `preview_aspect' is removed. It's automatically
converted to the new option `preview_expand'.
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 1.16.1
</h2>
You must rename manually the Linux config directories to `$home/.advance' and
`$prefix/share/advance'. (Previously they were `*/advmame').
<h2> 
AdvanceMENU 1.16.0
</h2>
The format of the configuration file is changed.
These are the instruction to convert your "mm.cfg" to the new format :
<ul>
<li>
Copy the file "mm.cfg" in the same directory of advmenu.exe.
</li>
<li>
Ensure that a file named "advmenu.rc" doesn't exist.
</li>
<li>
Run "advmenu.exe".
</li>
<li>
A file named "advmenu.rc" should be now present in your current directory.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This conversion works only for the DOS version of AdvanceMENU.
