.SH NAME
device drivers \(hy AdvanceMAME Device Drivers
.PP
This file describes the video, sound, joystick, mouse
and keyboard drivers used by the Advance programs.
.SH VIDEO DRIVERS 
.SS Types of Drivers 
The video drivers can be divided in two different categories:
.PD 0
.IP \(bu
Generate drivers able to program directly the video board.
.IP \(bu
System drivers able to use only the available video modes.
.PD
.SS Generate drivers 
This set of drivers is able to program directly the video board
to always generate a perfect video mode with the correct size
and frequency.
.PP
They always work in \(oqfullscreen\(cq output mode and generally
support only a subset of video boards.
.PP
To function correctly these drivers require a correct
configuration of the \(oqdevice_video_*\(cq options.
.PP
The \(oqGenerate\(cq drivers are always the preferred choice.
.SS System drivers 
This set of drivers is able to use only the video modes
available on the operating system.
.PP
They can work in \(oqfullscreen\(cq mode, \(oqwindow\(cq mode and \(oqzoom\(cq
output mode using the video board hardware acceleration to
stretch the image. The default output mode is \(oqwindow\(cq if you
run the program in a window manager, otherwise the output
mode \(oqfullscreen\(cq is chosen.
.PP
Please note that these drivers generally need to stretch the
image losing a lot in image quality and speed.
.PP
These drivers don\(cqt require any \(oqdevice_video_*\(cq options
because they cannot control how the video modes are generated.
.SS Available Generate Drivers 
The following is the list of all the video drivers supported.
.SS svgalib \(hy Generate SVGA video (Linux) 
This driver works in Linux and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the hardware registers of the recognized SVGA boards using
the SVGALIB library.
.PP
All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.
This driver is generally able to synchronize with the vertical sync
of the video mode.
.PP
To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a \(oqsvgalib\(cq driver listed in the \(oqcardlinx.txt\(cq file.
To use this driver you need to install the SVGALIB library
version 1.9.x.
.PP
To use this driver you need to correctly configure the
SVGALIB HorizSync and VertRefresh options in the
file /etc/vga/libvga.config file.
You must use a range equal or a bit larger than the range
specified with the AdvanceMAME \(oqdevice_video_clock\(cq option.
.PP
This driver is not available in X (when the environment DISPLAY
variable is defined).
.SS fb \(hy Generate Frame Buffer video (Linux) 
This driver works in Linux and is able to create video modes
using the Linux Kernel Frame Buffer interface.
.PP
All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.
.PP
This driver is able to use the Linux fb API to synchronize
with the vertical sync of the video mode, but generally
it isn\(cqt possible because the low\(hyend drivers don\(cqt support
this feature. Anyway, if you run the program as root it can
use the standard VGA registers to detect the vsync.
This is the major limitation compared with the svgalib driver.
.PP
To allow any user to run the program as root, you can
use the following commands to change the executable
permissions:
.PP
.RS 4
chown root:root /usr/local/bin/advmame
.PD 0
.PP
.PD
chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/advmame
.PD 0
.PP
.PD
.RE
.PP
To use this driver you must activate the Console Frame Buffer
support in your Linux kernel.
.PP
This driver is not available in X (when the environment DISPLAY
variable is defined).
.PP
The Frame Buffer device opened is \(oq/dev/fb0\(cq and \(oq/dev/fb/0\(cq, you
can change it setting the FRAMEBUFFER environment variable.
.PP
The generic Frame Buffer \(oqvesafb\(cq driver cannot be used because
it doesn\(cqt allow the creation of new video modes. If it\(cqs your
only option you can use it through the SDL library.
.SS svgaline \(hy Generate SVGA video (DOS) 
This driver works in DOS and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the hardware registers of the recognized SVGA boards.
.PP
All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.
.PP
To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a \(oqsvgaline\(cq driver listed in the \(oqcarddos.txt\(cq file.
.PP
This driver is completely independent of the VGA/VBE BIOS
of your board.
.SS vbeline \(hy Generate VBE video (DOS) 
This driver works in DOS and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the standard VBE (VESA) BIOS mode changing the hardware
registers of the SVGA.
.PP
All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.
.PP
To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a \(oqvbeline\(cq driver listed in the \(oqcarddos.txt\(cq file.
.PP
These drivers work setting a video mode using the
default VBE2 services and tweak some hardware SVGA
registers to modify the obtained video mode.
The driver \(oqvbe3\(cq is an exception. It requires the
presence of a VBE3 BIOS to change the frequency of the
desired video mode. Unfortunately the standard
VBE3 services don\(cqt support a resolution size change.
.PP
The resolution is changed modifying only the standard
VGA registers. This hack may or not may works.
Also the interlaced modes are only rarely supported
by the various VBE3 BIOS because they are very rarely
used in the standard PC monitors.
.PP
If your video board isn\(cqt supported by any drivers and
you don\(cqt have a VBE3 BIOS you can try installing a
software VESA BIOS like the SciTech Display Doctor.
.SS vgaline \(hy Generate VGA video (DOS) 
This driver works in DOS and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the hardware registers of the standard VGA.
.PP
Only the standard VGA pixel clocks 6.29, 7.08, 12.59,
14.16 MHz are available. Only 8 bit color modes. Only
64 kBytes of video memory.
.PP
This driver supports also text modes with pixel clocks
12.59, 14.16, 25.17, 28.32 MHz.
.PP
This driver is completely independent of the VGA BIOS
of your board.
.SS svgawin \(hy Generate SVGA video (Windows) 
This driver works in Windows NT/2000/XP and is able to use video
modes obtained tweaking the hardware registers of the recognized
SVGA boards.
.PP
All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.
.PP
To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a \(oqsvgawin\(cq driver listed in the \(oqcardwin.txt\(cq file.
.PP
To use this driver you need to install the included SVGAWIN
driver. Please read the \(oqsvgawin.txt\(cq file carefully.
.PP
This driver is experimental. At present it\(cqs only tested on
Windows 2000 with a GeForce 2 board. It may not work will
all the other boards.
.SS Available System Drivers 
The following is the list of all the System video drivers supported.
.SS sdl \(hy System SDL video (Linux, Windows and Mac OS X) 
This driver works in Linux, Windows and Mac OS X and is able to
use video modes reported by the SDL graphics library.
.PP
It supports all RGB/YUY2 bit depths available.
The output in the YUY2 modes is generally accelerated, and can
be used to scale the video output to an arbitrary size.
You can enable this feature with the \(oq\(hydevice_video_output overlay\(cq
option.
.PP
You can change some options of this driver using the SDL specific
environment variables described in the contrib/sdl/env.txt file.

.SS oss \(hy OSS sound (Linux) 
This driver works in Linux and it uses the OSS sound library.
.SS sdl \(hy SDL sound (Linux, Windows and Mac OS X) 
This driver works in Linux, Windows and Mac OS X and it uses
the SDL library.
.PP
It isn\(cqt able to use the hardware volume control of the sound card.
The volume changes are simulated reducing the sample values.
.PP
It isn\(cqt able to precisely control the amount of bufferized samples.
This means that it may add a small latency on the sound output.
.PP
You can change some options of this driver using the SDL specific
environment variables described in the contrib/sdl/env.txt file.
