		<h2>Controls</h2>
		<p>
		The MAME4ALL menu controls are described at the bottom of the menu screen.
		</p><p>
		Game controls follow the standard MAME configuration, with a few notable exceptions in
		order to better match the Pandora's control layout. All controls can be reconfigured
		in the MAME menu, either globally or per game. The most important default controls are:
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left">D-Pad</th><td>Movement/Joystick</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">B,X,A,Y,L,R</th><td>Buttons 1 thru 6</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">Keypad ".", Shift, Q, A</th><td>Buttons 1 thru 4 for use in rotated mode</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">Select (or 5)</th><td>Insert coin (player 1)</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">Start (or 1)</th><td>Start (player 1)</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">6,7,8</th><td>Insert coin (players 2 thru 4)</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">2,3,4</th><td>Start (players 2 thru 4)</td></tr>			
			<tr><th align="left">P</th><td>Pause</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">Tab (Fn+Space) or Pandora button</th><td>MAME configuration menu</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left">Escape (Fn+Q)</th><td>Quit game and return to main menu</td></tr>
		</table>

		<h2>Settings</h2>
		After selecting a game, a menu is displayed in which you may alter the following settings:
		<h3>Video Aspect</h3>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Normal</b></th><td>
				Selects a scaling mode which attempts to create as large as possible an image,
				closely matching the physical screen dimensions. Borders or clipping (max 10% in
				either axis) may occur.
				<br/>
				<b>Tip:</b> use Shift+A/B/X/Y to pan the screen if clipping obscures important details.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Scale</b></th><td>
				Scale the image to fill the screen, but maintaining the game's
				original (pixel) aspect ratio.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Stretch</b></th><td>
				Scale the image to fill the screen comletely, ignoring the game's
				original aspect ratio.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>4:3</b></th><td>
				Scale the image to fill the screen, but force a 4:3 aspect ratio (or
				3:4 for vertically oriented games).
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Fit</b></th><td>
				Select the largest integer scale which will fit completely within the
				physical screen dimensions. No borders or clipping will occur, but may
				result in a very small image for some games.
			</td></tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3>Video Rotation</h3>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>OFF</b></th><td>
				Graphics are displayed upright when screen is viewed horizontally.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>ON</b></th><td>
				Graphics are rotated 90 degrees to the right, allowing vertically-oriented
				games to be played with the entire console rotated. The D-Pad controls are
				automatically remapped to match the rotated console.
			</td></tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Video Filter</h3>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Auto</b></th><td>
				Automatically apply a smoothing video filter if the selected Video Aspect mode
				results in a non-integer scaling factor.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>None</b></th><td>
				Never apply a smoothing filter, regardless of scale. May result in scaling artefacts
				depending on the selected Video Aspect mode.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Default</b></th><td>
				Always apply the default smoothing filter. May causes loss of sharpness depending
				on the selected Video Aspect mode.
			</td></tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Video Sync</h3>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Normal</b></th><td>
				Single buffering with dirty buffer.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>VSync</b></th><td>
				Wait for vertical blanking when syncing video. This eliminates "tearing" of the
				display. Double buffering is also enabled.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>DblBuf</b></th><td>
				Enable double buffering to prevent the display from flickering.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>None</b></th><td>
				Do not sync video (use manual frame-skip).
			</td></tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Frame-Skip</h3>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Auto</b></th><td>
				Automatically adjust frame skip in real time.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>0-11</b></th><td>
				Manual frame-skip adjustment. For every 12 frames, skip the specified number of frames.
			</td></tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3>Sound</h3>
		Flip through the options to select:
		<ul>
			<li>Frequency: 11, 15, 22, 33 or 44 KHz</li>
			<li>Mono/Stereo</li>
			<li>Fast mode: improved performance at the expense of sound quality.</li>
			<li>OFF: disable sound completely.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>CPU Clock/Audio Clock</h3>
		<p>
		The clock of the emulated processors can be adjusted from 50% to 200%. The nominal value
		is 100%, at which speed the CPU is emulated accurately. The CPU clock can be safely
		underclocked to about 80% to gain performance in almost all games. Lower values
		should increase performance but may prevent games from running properly. The CPU can
		also be overclocked up to 200% to avoid slowdowns in some Neo-Geo games.
		</p>
		
		<h3>CPU ASM cores</h3>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Cyclone</b></th><td>
				Use the Cyclone M68000 CPU core, which is faster than the standard C core.
				Enabled by default as it seems to have perfect compatibility.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>DrZ80</b></th><td>
				Use the DrZ80 CPU core, which is faster than the standard C core.
				Compatibility is limited; use only if the chosen game runs properly.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Cyclone+DrZ80</b></th><td>
				Enable both ASM cores for optimum perfromance.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Drz80(snd)</b></th><td>
				Enable DrZ80 core for audio processors only.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>Cyclone+DrZ80(snd)</b></th><td>
				Enable Cyclone M68000 CPU core. Enable DrZ80 core for audio processors only.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>None</b></th><td>
				Disable all ASM cores. Best compatability, worst performance.
			</td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>
		<b>Note</b>: this configuration is automatically adjusted in each game
		according to an internal compatibility list.
		</p>

		<h3>Cheats</h3>
		<table>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>ON</b></th><td>
				Enable cheats, accessed in-game through the "Cheats" section of the MAME menu.
			</td></tr>
			<tr><th align="left"><b>OFF</b></th><td>
				Disable cheats.
			</td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>
		<b>Note</b>: High scores are not saved if cheats are enabled!
