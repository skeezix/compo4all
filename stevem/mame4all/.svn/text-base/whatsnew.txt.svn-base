
MAME4ALL 2.5 (09/03/2010)
-------------------------
- Added volume control to the frontend. Also the default volume is lowered down.
- Fixed memory bug with games containing multiple FM sound systems. This stops some games crashing on exit.
- New option to enable DRZ80 only for the sound CPUs. Improves the compatibility of DRZ80.
  It is automatically enabled to gain speed in several games (e.g. several Capcom, Sega and Midway games).
- Several other fixes taken from Slaanesh code (GP32 and Dingoo ports).
- Added new skins from GP32 and Dingoo ports (by Antiriad and Slaanesh).
- Added script to use 64 MB of additional virtual memory (swap file on the SD card).
  It will reduce the life of the SD card. Use at your own risk!.
- GP2X: Upper memory is used as primary memory for all memory allocations to avoid lock-ups due to
  memory management bugs. Not used for the Neo·Geo executable (to be able to run the heaviest games).
- WIZ: Added support for hardware timer. Not enabled yet (it seems to slow down the emulator a bit).
- Source code clean-up to avoid port definitions in the common part. Also improved makefiles are created.
- Preliminary integration of the ARMNEC core (created by Oopsware).
  Some games start to run but nothing playable yet. Disabled for now.

MAME4ALL 2.4 (05/08/2009)
-------------------------
GP2X WIZ version improvements:
- Added full image scaling (Rampage, Popeye, Super Sprint, etc).
  Horizontal scaling with linear filtering is still used internally when applicable.
- More Neo·Geo games are playable, e.g. Art of Fighting 3, Fatal Fury and Pulstar.
  Still some games run in the GP2X and not in the WIZ due to lack of memory.
  (blazstar, kof96, mslug2, ninjamas, ragnagrd, rbff1 and shocktro)
- Upper memory is used as primary memory for all memory allocations. If the upper memory 
  is full, the Linux memory is used instead. Strangely the emulator is faster using this
  approach and it avoids lock-ups.
- No more lock-ups when exiting from games to the frontend (e.g. Out Run, Shinobi, etc).

MAME4ALL 2.3 (11/07/2009)
-------------------------
Changes by Franxis:
- WIZ: Added VSync option. Thanks to Exophase.
- WIZ: 120 Hz video mode is used to solve issues with latest firmware 1.1.0 and to improve the performance with VSync
  option enabled. Also the diagonal line is less noticeable. Thanks Exophase and Notaz for the pollux_set library.
- WIZ: Replaced MMUHack by wARM kernel module. Thanks to Notaz.
- WIZ: Added option to enable RAM tweaks to gain more speed. Thanks to Notaz for the pollux_set library.
- WIZ: The option to fix completely the diagonal line is now accesible in the "Video Aspect" menu.
- WIZ: More upper memory is available because the video frame-buffers are placed in the kernel part of the upper memory
  (located at 0x2A00000).
- Improved controls: Defender, Stargate, Vindicators, Battle Zone, Sarge, Assault, TNK III, Ikari Warriors,
  Victory Road, Guerrilla War, Bermuda Triangle, Heavy Barrel, Midnight Resistance, Robotron, Inferno, Splat!,
  Forgotten Worlds, Gondomania, Mad Planets, Top Gunner, Tron, Kozmik Kroozr, Discs of Tron, Crater Raider,
  Zwackery, Search and Rescue, Ikari III, Time Soldiers, Battle Field, Aztarac, Black Widow, Rescue Rider,
  Crazy Climber 2, Bandido, Sheriff, Smash T.V., Total Carnage, Wild Western, Front Line, The Tin Star, Mars,
  Rescue, Minefield, Lost Tomb, Space Dungeon, The Return of Ishtar, Crazy Climber, Cloak & Dagger, Fire Trap,
  Krull, Screw Loose, Karate Champ.
- Fixed crashes in Midway games using TMS34010 CPU (caused by unaligned memory accesses). Also the CPU frequencies have
  been tweaked to gain speed.
- Added access to the profiler (L+MENU) and the FPS counter (R+SELECT).

Changes by Slaanesh:
- New romsets added: Momoko 120% (momoko), Fire Truck (firetrk), Fairyland Story (flstory), Fairyland Story (Japan) (flstoryj),
  Kuri Kinton (World) (kurikint), Kuri Kinton (prototype) (kurikina), Play Girls (plgirls), Play Girls 2 (plgirls2),
  Cuby Bop (cubybop), Tube-It (tubeit), Raimais (Japan) (raimais).
- Improved sound in Taito L-System drivers. This adds sounds to some games where it was previously missing (ie. Fighting Hawk).
- Sound improved in X-Men. Added K05439 sound CPU support.

MAME4ALL 2.2 (13/06/2009)
-------------------------
Changes by Franxis:
- New timers system based on integers instead of floats. This gives more performance (10% to 25% depending on the game)!.
  I have been working on it for months and finally it works. Please report any posible bug.
- Removed M72 sound hack, it is not needed now, M72 games run full-speed with the new timers system.
- Optimizations in the sound cores (mixing and clipping).
- Neo·Geo drivers are not compiled in the main executable, they are only compiled in the 'neomame' executable.
- Some other tweaks to decrease the size of the executables.
- Fixed the icon to be correctly shown in GP2X and WIZ latest firmwares.
- WIZ: Added option to use 11 KHz and 15 KHz sound. The WIZ Linux port doesn't support such frequencies yet.
  They are really converted to 22 KHz during sound playback. Anyway more performance is gained.

Changes by Slaanesh:
- Added new romsets from MAME 0.37b16:
  Knuckle Joe (set 1) (kncljoe)
  Knuckle Joe (set 2) (kncljoea)
- Updated Taito F2 driver. Sprite scaling for Dead Connection and others.
- Improved sound in Rygar. Still not perfect.
- Updated Blockout driver. Still crashes at bonus round.

MAME4ALL 2.1 (31/05/2009)
-------------------------
- GP2X WIZ version improvements:
  Added MMU Hack kernel module by Notaz. It gives more performance.
  Added more CPU frequencies selectable in the frontend.
  MENU button is fire button in rotated video mode.
  Option to draw the screen rotated to fix the diagonal line but with impact in the performance.
- Some optimizations and bug-fixes in the timers.
- Less frame-skip is applied (changed the threshold to consider full speed in the auto-frameskip code, from 99% to 92%).
- Slaanesh added discrete sound system. So far only Canyon Bomber has been updated. It now has sound but it is slow.

MAME4ALL 2.0 (16/05/2009)
-------------------------
- GP2X WIZ version added:
  + Faster than the GP2X version.
  + It contains some specific features, such as horizontal scaling with linear filtering in 16 bit color mode.
  Thanks to EvilDragon for sending me the development unit from GPH.
  Thanks to Puck2099 for all the information and his Pico library.
  Thanks to Orkie for all the help and his Castor library.
  Thanks to Exophase for the MMU hack library.
  Thanks to Pickle and KungPhoo for all the information about the sound.
  Thanks to Rlyeh for the GP2X minimal library, taken as a base for the WIZ code.
  Thanks to Zenzuke for the WIZ artwork.
- All source code files related to each of the drivers are compiled together to allow the compiler
  to improve the code location and to have better cache usage. Some games run faster now.
- Fixed a bug in the auto-frameskip code. In some games the auto frame-skip was incremented without
  reason due to rounding issues (99% - 100%).
- Double precision float is replaced by single precision in several parts of the code. Nice speed increase.
- Better compiler options. Everything is a little faster now.
- Several internal changes and source code clean-up. Smaller binaries.
- Hack in the CPU frequency clock in Mortal Kombat. Running a lot faster now.
- Hack in the M72 games sound (Hammerin' Harry, etc). Digitized sound disabled with the fast sound option.
  Running a lot faster now.
- Slaanesh added support for some Argus games (MAME 0.37b11): 
  Argus (argus)
  Butasan (Japan) (butasan)
  Valtric (valtric)
